I have been interested in AI and autonomous cars for a very long time, hence why my university final year project 
was trying to eliminate blind spots for drivers, as a first step in to Computer vision and machine learning. 

Since working in a factory I have been thinking about my project and have always wanted to take it a step further(wanting a 
job in this field), so i bought The Complete Self-Driving Car Course - Applied Deep Learning from Udemy, 
which has been giving me insight to the various new frameworks and libraries that help with Computer Vision
and Machine Learning like OpenCV, Keras, Tensorflow.
